where ''[[Ψ]]'' is the [[wave function]] of the quantum system, ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]], ''ħ'' is the
[[reduced Planck constant]], and <math>\hat{H}</math> is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]
[[operator (physics)|operator]], which characterizes the total energy of any given wavefunction and takes different
forms depending on the situation.

[[File:Wave packet (dispersion).gif|thumb|200px|A [[wave function]] which satisfies the non-relativistic Schrödinger
 equation with ''V''=0. In other words, this corresponds to a particle traveling freely through empty space.
 The [[real part]] of the [[wave function]] is plotted here.]]
The most famous example is the [[relativistic quantum mechanics|non-relativistic]] Schrödinger equation for a single
particle moving in an [[electric field]] (but not a [[magnetic field]]):

where ''m'' is the particle's mass, ''V'' is its [[potential energy]], ∇² is the [[Laplacian]], and ''Ψ'' is the
 wavefunction (more precisely, in this context, it is called the "position-space wavefunction").
 In plain language, it means "total energy equals [[kinetic energy]] plus [[potential energy]]",
  but the terms take unfamiliar forms for reasons explained below.
